In this project, we aim to explore various aspects of programming, focusing on Python scripting. We will learn about APIs, specifically REST APIs, microservices, data formats such as CSV and JSON, and Python coding style following PEP8 guidelines.

0. Gather data from an API
Write a Python script that retrieves information about an employee's TODO list progress using a REST API. The script should accept an integer as a parameter (employee ID) and display the employee's TODO list progress in a specific format.

1. Export to CSV
Extend the previous Python script to export data in CSV format. The CSV file should include information about tasks owned by the employee.

2. Export to JSON
Extend the Python script to export data in JSON format. The JSON file should include information about tasks owned by the employee.

3. Dictionary of list of dictionaries
Extend the Python script to export data in JSON format containing records of all tasks from all employees.
